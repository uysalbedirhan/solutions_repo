Theoretical Background A forced damped pendulum illustrates the dynamics of nonlinear oscillators.

When both damping and an external periodic force are applied to a pendulum, its behavior ranges from steady oscillations to complex, even chaotic motion. This diversity mimics many real-world systems found in engineering and nature. By varying physical parameters such as damping, force amplitude, and frequency, we can observe behaviors including resonance, phase locking, and chaos. These insights are essential for understanding oscillatory systems in fields like mechanics, electronics, and biomechanics. 1. Mathematical Framework Differential Equation The motion of the forced damped pendulum is described by a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE): Where: : angular displacement : damping coefficient : acceleration due to gravity : pendulum length : driving force amplitude : angular frequency of the external force Basic Physics Connection This system obeys Newton's Second Law: For rotational motion, this becomes: Here, the torque is due to gravity, damping, and the driving force. Linear Approximation (Small Angle) For small angular displacements: The equation simplifies to: This form allows for analytical approximation and is useful to analyze predictable, non-chaotic behaviors. 2. Parameter-Based Behavior Analysis By varying: Damping Drive amplitude Drive frequency We can observe: Underdamped vs. overdamped responses Resonance peaks Onset of complex or chaotic behavior 3.
